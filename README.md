# Abstract of paper
Team-Based Learning (TBL), a pedagogical approach that positively influences classroom attendance, still needs help with student absenteeism. Current attendance tracking tools are designed for something other than TBL environments and require manual interaction from the instructor or students, consuming valuable class time. This paper introduces a novel approach to this problem, proposing an automated attendance tool for TBL classes using fixed sensors, either a camera or a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), combined with a machine learning classification algorithm. The paper delves into a comparative study of using cameras and LiDAR for this purpose, evaluating them based on privacy, accuracy, efficiency, and perceptions of students and instructors. The results indicate that while both methods successfully record attendance, the LiDAR system was more efficient and reliable. Although the camera offered a higher accuracy rate, a better customized LiDAR dataset designed for the classroom environment could enhance the machine learning algorithmâ€™s accuracy in identifying students and recording attendance. Finally, the LiDAR system was favored by both students and instructors for its ease of use, non-intrusiveness, and privacy preservation.
